"""Phase 5: Planner and synthesizer for multi-part question decomposition.

The planner classifies incoming questions as simple or multi-part. Simple
questions pass through unchanged to the existing CRAG flow. Multi-part
questions are decomposed into focused sub-queries that are each answered
independently, then the synthesizer combines the sub-answers into a
coherent, citation-preserving final response.

This addresses the legal/compliance analyst persona (US2) who asks questions
spanning multiple contracts or departments.
